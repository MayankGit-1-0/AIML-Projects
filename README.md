# 🤖 End-to-End AI/ML Projects

Welcome to my AI/ML portfolio! This repository serves as a collection of my machine learning projects, ranging from classical regression models to deep learning with RNNs.

## 📂 Project Directory

| Project Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[House Price Prediction](./House_Price_Prediction)** | Regression | A model to predict housing prices based on features like location, size, and amenities. |
| **[Movie Recommendation System](./MovieRecom)** | Recommender | A content-based/collaborative filtering system to suggest movies to users. |
| **[Movie Review Analysis](./MovieReview)** | NLP / Sentiment | Natural Language Processing project to classify movie reviews (Positive/Negative). |
| **[LSTM RNN](./LSTM%20RNN)** | Deep Learning | implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence data. Predicting next word for Hamlet dataset. |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Streamlit
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 Getting Started
To explore a specific project, simply click the project name in the table above to navigate to its folder. Each project contains its own source code and datasets.

### How to Clone
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/MayankGit-1-0/AIML-Projects.git](https://github.com/MayankGit-1-0/AIML-Projects.git)
cd AIML-Projects

### **How to use this:**
1.  Go to your repository root folder.
2.  Open (or create) the `README.md` file.
3.  Paste the code above.
4.  Commit the changes.

**Why this structure works:**
* **Clickable Links:** The `[Link Name](./Folder_Name)` syntax works automatically on GitHub. I used the exact folder names I saw in your repo (`House_Price_Prediction`, `MovieRecom`, `MovieReview`, `LSTM RNN`).
* **Professional Table:** Recruiters love tables because they are easy to scan.
* **%20 Trick:** Notice the link for `LSTM%20RNN`. Since that folder name has a space in it, we must use `%20` in the link for it to work.
